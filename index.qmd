:::{#about-me}
I am social scientist and a geographer interested in data science. My big research question is: **"how can we understand the social and political sphere in  the digital age?"**. I try to provide answers this question by using large quantitative, text, digital trace data and computational methods. In this blog, I share my opinions on data science and (South Africa) political and social dynamics.
