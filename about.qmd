I am a social scientist and geographer based at the University of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. I am interested in data science and computational social science. My research can be summarised in four words: political, social, space, data!. Specifically, I research on:

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}

- Political economy

- Neighbourhood contexts (education outcomes, health, deprivation)

- Political participation (protest, elections, behaviour)

:::
  
::: {.g-col-6}

- Youth studies

- Social theory (Foucault ❤️, Agamben, governance, markets)

- Political geography

I use data science tools, computational methods and statistical methods in my research. I enjoy programming in R and Python. I have extensive research experience and been involved in various research projects focusing on Innovation for Development and Social and Economic Impact Assessment and Evaluation.
